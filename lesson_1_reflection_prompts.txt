How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    you can see what has change in the code before the bug was introduced and after
    therefor you can know what is causeing the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you can find bugs in the code much faster
    if u add code the you want to unadd you can easly remove it
    if you add features to the program you can see who you did it before and help yourself to do it again

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros:
	you can add your comments on each version added
	you can add when ever you see fit to add new version
    cons:
	you might forget to add version in cretical fork roads
	you might add unessery versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    i think because Git is create for programs version control,
    and programs might have more than one file in order to run,
    and in most cases each file is depending on other files,
    however Google docs it for documents, which rearly is depending on each other,
    so... a change in a file won't effiect other files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    by using git log you can see every change that we have commited,
    including date of change and comments on the changes,
    using git diff we can compare two version of the code in two diffrent time points

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because you can go back to older versions when ever you want,
    moreovere you can see what changes eacly broke the code and fix them

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    at the mean time on answering this qustions in ordere to give someone else to answer then and compare to answers
