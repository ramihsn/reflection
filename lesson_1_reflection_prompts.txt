How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    therefor you can know what is causeing the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you can find bugs in the code much faster
    if u add code the you want to unadd you can easly remove it
    if you add features to the program you can see who you did it before and help yourself to do it again

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros:
	you can add your comments on each version added
	you can add when ever you see fit to add new version
    cons:
	you might forget to add version in cretical fork roads
	you might add unessery versions
