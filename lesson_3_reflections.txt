when would you wnat to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    starting now :)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    in order to control when to keep up with others,
    because in every pull you get new bransh that might make you have to modify changes
    on your code manually, rather than that, it's better to let me deside whern to pull branshes.
